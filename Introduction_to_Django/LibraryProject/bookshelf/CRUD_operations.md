# Import Book model
In [1]: from bookshelf.models import Book

# Check current Book records
In [2]: Book.objects.all()
Out[2]: <QuerySet []>

# --- CREATE ---
# Create a Book instance
In [3]: b = Book.objects.create(title="1984", author="George Orwell", publication_year=1949)
# Save to database
In [4]: b.save()

# Verify creation
In [5]: Book.objects.all()
Out[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: '1984', written by George Orwell, released in 1949>]>

# --- READ ---
# Access book attributes

In [6]: b = Book.objects.get(title="Nineteen Eighty-Four")

In [7]: b.title
Out[7]: '1984'

In [8]: b.publication_year
Out[8]: 1949

# --- UPDATE ---
In [11]: book = Book.objects.get(title="1984")
